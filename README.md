# The assignment is to write some code that will ask the user to do one of three things:
  1.) The user could choose to add a new car
      a.) If this option is chosen, then they would need to type the year the car was made in, the make of the car, and the             model as well.
  2.) The user could choose to see the list of cars
  3.) The user could opt out of the program
